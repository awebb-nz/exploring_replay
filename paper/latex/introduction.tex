\begin{itemize}
    \item For MDPs, online planning is difficult
    \item M\&D solution
    \item However, the 'real' problem is BAMDPs/POMDPs -- and replay has been suggested for this
    \item M\&D did not consider this setting
    \item We fix, show the importance of sequences - something that had not surfaced before - and relate to the limited data
\end{itemize}
